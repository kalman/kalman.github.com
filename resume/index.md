## Employment

### **Salesforce** &bull; Software Engineering Architect (Quip) &bull; 2018-2022

*TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Web, React, Node.js, AWS, iOS, Windows.*

[Quip](https://quip.com/) is a real-time collaborative document, spreadsheet, and chat application for web, desktop, and mobile. It was structured as a largely independent company within Salesforce until Salesforce acquired Slack in 2021, when it became part of Slack.

* Responsible for managing and often implementing Quip's client toolchain: node, TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Storybook, WebDriver, rollup, jest, babel, prettier, eslint, vite, and Python. Roughly 50% of Quip engineers use this for their daily workflow.
* General expert on client code quality and health, primarily in TypeScript, React, and related tooling. Provided general engineering advice, code review, and core library maintenance.
* Technical lead for Quip's slides product. I was responsible for frontend feature development in TypeScript and React with some Python, interfacing with the product and design team, triaging and prioritising external client issues, and reviewing design and code of other team members.
* Developed and reviewed many miscellaneous features across Quip's core document product, primarily in TypeScript, React, and full stack integration with Quip's Python server backend.
* Occasionally seen deploying and maintaining Quip's Windows application.

### **Attic Labs** &bull; Software Engineer &bull; 2015-2018

*Go, JavaScript, Flow, React Native, Web, GraphQL, iOS.*

Attic Labs was an 8-person startup that developed [Noms](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms), a novel open source database. It was acquired by Salesforce in 2018.

* Implemented core features of Noms' Go implementation, including the sophisticated ["Probabilistic B-Tree"](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/blob/master/doc/intro.md#prolly-trees-probabilistic-b-trees) technology. My work here is open source and can be seen on [GitHub](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/commits?author=kalman).
* Co-inventor of patent [US11030187B1](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11030187B1/en) based on this work.
* Core developer of the open source JavaScript and Flow implementation.
* Implemented several tools written in Go that demonstrate and manipulate a Noms database.
* Core developer of a web and iOS photo sharing app built on top of the Noms database. I wrote a significant portion of the stack using Javascript, Flow, React Native, GraphQL, and Go. Attic Labs was acquired before it launched.

### **Google** &bull; Staff Software Engineer &bull; 2009-2015

*C++, JavaScript, Chrome Extensions, Python, Java.*

At Google I spent 5 years working on Google Chrome, the desktop web browser used by billions of people. Most of these were developing the Chrome Extensions platform, installable applications most visible as large buttons on Chrome's toolbar, where I was a Staff Software Engineer and technical lead for the last 2 years.

* As technical lead, I set priorities and technical leadership for the team, with a focus on security and speed. My approval was required for all new APIs developed for the Chrome Extensions platform.
* Responsible for general maintenance and improvement of the platform itself.
* Interacted with the open source community that is built around Chrome Extensions. This included hobbyists, engineers from large companies that shipped Chrome Extensions (including Google), and companies built entirely around Chrome Extensions such as AdBlock.
* Provided design and code review for many APIs across different teams in the Google Chrome organisation and elsewhere inside Google.
* Designed, implemented, and wrote the documentation for fundamental APIs in C++ and JavaScript, for example [chrome.storage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/) and [activeTab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/activeTab/).
* I am co-inventor of patent [US9535755B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9535755B2/en) based on the synchronisation feature of the chrome.storage API.

My first year at Google was on Google Wave, the short-lived email competitor.

* Worked on an open source implementation of the Google Wave frontend and backend in Java, and the open communication protocol between it and our proprietary backend. Having an open protocol was key to Google Wave being a viable email competitor.
* Implemented small miscellaneous features on the web frontend in Java with Google Web Toolkit.

### NICTA &bull; ERTOS Research Associate &bull; 2009

*C, Python.*

NICTA was Australia's IT research centre, later renamed Data61 and merged with CSIRO. I worked with the Operation Systems group, called ERTOS. I built productivity tools, contributed to a version of the Linux Kernel being developed by ERTOS, and contributed to the [seL4](https://sel4.systems) project.

## Education

### BSc Computer Science (Honours) &bull; UNSW &bull; 2005-2009
